# JenkinsPLwithAnsible
Install Docker and Docker-Compose with Ansible in Jenkins Pipeline using Ansible. Docker and Docker-Compose may be used for further installations when needed.
You should have configured Jenkins to use the branch where you have the files (prepare_ansible_server.sh), Jenkins file, and the Ansible folder.
